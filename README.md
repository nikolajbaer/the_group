Abstract
-------- 

When I was young, my grandfather (and old professor of metallurgy) told me that if you don't understand something, write a book about it. During the course of my education and subsequent professional career as a computer programmer, then manager of computer programmers, I have had a slow awakening to crucial subtleties of how people react in groups. Add to this a moderate interest in politics, the turmoils of personal relationships, and the observation of my growing twin daughters, and I had a fertile ground of human interpersonal and group dynamics that sometimes made sense, often didn't, and provided endless challenge in navigating.

This is my attempt to do what a typical software developer would do: abstract out the underlying algorithms, data structures, systems and workflows that make it tick in the hopes to understand, solve, optimize, and refactor. What are the underlying incentives that encourage good teamwork in an office place? How does confidence effect your efficacy in a task? Why is inequality seem so intractable?  

I will have to cover a lot of terrain to do this, and to make my challenge perhaps easier (and perhaps harder), I want this to be a visual work, with illustrations driving down the underlying equation of a common interaction or relationship. My hope is to have the opportunity to structure my own thinking, as well as help others internalize what is really going on, and how to solve a challenge with people by focusing on what is really happening. Consider this like a diagram in a physics book, perhaps showing the relationship between some cables, pullies, springs, and weights.
