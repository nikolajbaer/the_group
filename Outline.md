Part 1: Communicating 
==========================

As soon as you are no longer alone, you are presented with the challenge of communciation. It scales exponentially as you get grow, and our capacity is so limited.

**What is communication**
    - Having the same mental model or image
    - reference TED Talk and other info
    - context sensitive vs context free?
    - illustration: Two people talking, and thinking of two different things

**Lossy Communication**
    - Need better keyword / title
    - Our minds have all these models and understandings that are the result of our unique experiences
    - We have little tools to transmit a common model.. language, images, body language.. actions. All of these are so limited and trigger all sorts of notions
    - illustration: ?someone explaining a thing, and the other person interpreting something different

**Shared History** 
    - Having a shared history of things steramlines our communication. Think of it as compression.
    - When we speak the same language, we have reinforced the simple terms, and we can clearly understand "milk", or "hot", or "blue"
    - insight: Meetings / Time spent is an investment in shared history, even if they feel frustrating as you hash out a clearer common understanding
    - illustration: ?someone saying blue, and one person thinking of deep ocean blue, the other thinking of .. sky blue?

**Perspective**
    - Our perspective limits our shared history, or even corrupts it
    - It is hard to understand, or even disbelieve someone when you have a significatnly different perspective. Both could be part right and part wrong.
    - illustration: two or more people seeing the same thing from different angles, with significantly different conclusions

**Narratives**
    - Stories help us understand the genesis of a more complex topic
    - Capture more basic emotions with shared experiences
    - Crafted to drive to a conclusion, or common worldview
    - illustration: ?

**Lies**
    - Sometimes we predict someone else will make certain actions based upon what we say, and we don''t want those actions to transpire, so we intentionally present inaccurate information to give a false impression
    - TODO: think this through.. interesting.
    - illustration: ..

**Expectation**
    - Trust, or lack thereof
    - extend shared history and communication to drive anticipated result
    - risky maneuver,  
    - requires time to build, and potentially cannot be rebuilt

**Scaling Factors**
    - We can only create so much shared experience with a limited set of people
    - Crank it up beyond our immediate "tribe", and we are suddenly faced with making sweeping assumptions
    - Enter flags, religions, etc. We can capture a huge artificial shared history with these things, and yet they themselves are subject to all the breakdowns of basic person-to-person communication, yet with sweeping consequences.
    - Size Highlights Challenges
        * Pairs - 
        * Teams - When you have more than two, you start to become a team. This team is focused on pooling resources, as you can immediately accomplish more things with more than one person. However, the world is rife with uncertainty, and resources are inherently constrained, so teams immediately encounter two big challenges: collaborative decisions making and resource distribution.

Part 2: Decision Making
========================

**Consensus**
    - everyone must agree
    - does not scale
    - people are incentivized to pretend to agree

**Command**
    - one person / gorup drives a specific vision and plan
    - limits robustness, they inherently of less perspective

**Direct Democracy**
    - shared decision making
    - incredibly expensive. Nuances of all decisions are loaded to everyone in the group
    - easily exploited, hard to imagine it truly exists
    
**Representative Democracy**
    - scales better, but 
    -

Part 4: Organization?

Part 5: Distribution?
